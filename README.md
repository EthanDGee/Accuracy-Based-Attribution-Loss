# Accuracy-Based-Attribution-Loss

With the modern focus on RAG based systems that leverage AI based systems to accelerate the workflow by poroviing relevant responses based on user submitted content there has been a clear focus on preventing hallucations in cited content. The current approach to increase alignment is by fine tuning models on example datasets. Acquring these datasets is an incredibly time intensive process and requires a large amount of human work. These datasets are often very unexpansive and as a result can introduce bias as in order to provide accurate results a wide variety of domains to be represented in the example text. Trying to allieaviate these concerns I propose an automated method of determining accuracy by comparing the final generation to the source text. This allows for a far wider amount of texts to be represented while allowing for a broader text corpora to be easily trained on.
